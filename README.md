# A simsim fork for the FredChat

This fork changes small things about the bot to better fit in in the FredChat discord. The official readme can be seen below and a summary of changes is viewable directly below this 
- Removes almost all references to Matteo as that is not the name of the bot user
- Adds in new weather effects
- Adds the help command as the bot's status
- Shows a players vibes when requesting their stats
- Updated the credit command to credit Sakimori and SIBR instead of the pfp artist as the original profile pic is not being used
- Game history can be viewed in the same style embed as showallteams

## commands: (everything here is case sensitive, and can be prefixed with either m; or m!)

### team commands:
- m;saveteam
  - saves a team to the database allowing it to be used for games. send this command at the top of a list, with entries separated by new lines (shift+enter in discord, or copy+paste from notepad).
	- the first line of the list is your team's name (cannot contain emoji).
	- the second line is your team's icon and slogan, this should begin with an emoji followed by a space, followed by a short slogan.
	- the next lines are your batters' names in the order you want them to appear in your lineup, lineups can contain any number of batters between 1 and 12.
	- the final line is your pitcher's name.
  - if you did it correctly, you'll get a team embed with a prompt to confirm. hit the üëç and it'll be saved.
- m;showteam [name]
  - shows information about any saved team.
- m;showallteams
  - shows a paginated list of all teams available for games which can be scrolled through.	  
- m;searchteams [searchterm]
  - shows a paginated list of all teams whose names contain the given search term.
- m;deleteteam [teamname]
  - allows you to delete the team with the provided name if you are the owner of it, gives a confirmation first to prevent accidental deletions. if it isn't letting you delete your team, you probably created it before teams having owners was a thing, contact xvi and xie can assign you as the owner.
- m;import
  - imports an onomancer collection as a new team. you can use the new onomancer simsim setting to ensure compatibility.
  
### player commands:	 
- m;showplayer [name]
  - displays any name's stars, there's a limit of 70 characters. that should be *plenty*. note: if you want to lookup a lot of different players you can do it on onomancer instead of spamming this command a bunch and clogging up discord: https://onomancer.sibr.dev/reflect
- m;idolize [name]
  - records any name as your idol, mostly for fun.
- m;showidol 
  - displays your idol's name and stars.
  
### game commands:
- m;startgame
  - starts a game with premade teams made using saveteam, use this command at the top of a list followed by each of these in a new line:
	- the away team's name.
	- the home team's name.
	- and finally, optionally, the number of innings, which must be greater than 2 and less than 31. if not included it will default to 9.	  

### other commands:
- m;help [command]
  - shows the instructions from here for given command. if no command is provided, it will instead provide a list of all of the commands that instructions can be provided for.    
- m;credit
  - shows artist credit for matteo's avatar.  
- m;roman [number]
  - converts any natural number less than 4,000,000 into roman numerals, this one is just for fun.
